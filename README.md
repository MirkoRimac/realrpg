# 🧙‍♂️ RealRPG  
**Turn your life into a fantasy adventure**

## 🌱 About the Project

It all started as a simple **To-Do list experiment** just for fun.  
Then came the thought:  
> “What if I made it look more like a game?”

And then it *escalated*, fast.  

Now it’s a **RPG-style quest tracker** with characters, active quests, a level system, and a retro fantasy UI.  
It’s still growing, refactoring, and transforming, one quest at a time. ⚔️

## 🏗️ Current Status

> 🚧 **This project is still in active development.**  
> The current version is written in **vanilla PHP**, but a **Laravel migration** is already underway.  
> Some security improvements (like XSS prevention, CSRF tokens, and stronger input validation) will be part of that transition.  
> I’m aware that the current prototype is far from production-ready, it’s a playground for learning, experimenting, and improving.
