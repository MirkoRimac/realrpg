# RealRPG

This started as a small project — I just wanted to build a simple ToDo list for fun.  
But then I thought, "What if I made it look more like a game?"  
Then it escalated. Fast.

Now it's a full-blown RPG-style quest tracker with characters, active quests, progress bars, and a fantasy UI.  
It's still growing and evolving, and probably way more than I originally intended. But hey, it's been a fun ride.

Feel free to explore, break things, and maybe even use it.

## Features

- Register and log in as a user
- Create and track quests (aka ToDos)
- Level system (because why not)
- Progress bars and user stats
- Active quests dashboard
- Animated hero video on homepage
- Retro-style design using custom fonts

## Stack

- PHP (Vanilla)
- MySQL
- Bootstrap (for basic layout)
- Custom CSS

## Warning

This code isn't perfect. Some parts are messy. Some parts are kinda cool.  
It’s a side project that got out of hand — and I’m totally okay with that.
